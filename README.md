The charts are rendered using a modified version of [Peity](http://benpickles.github.com/peity/).

The dropdown is customized using a (slightly) modified version of [Dropkick](http://jamielottering.github.com/DropKick/).

Data is courtesy of The Guardian ([Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdHJ2TjFrNTNEVURFWkxtdHl6bm50YlE)), and is imported into a sqlite db with parse_tsv.py, and then tabulated in histogram.py.
